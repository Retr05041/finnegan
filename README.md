### Ideas..
So far the horizontal placing words.. since it's doing it first instead of vertical.. 
I could have it so it checks every cell around the current for non '.', or black cells, if there is it skips, else it tries either vertical or horizontal placements
ontop of that current one, allowing for an almost staircase look - if it can't place anything down it backtracks :)
